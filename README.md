Memeorandum Colors
==================

Browser add-on to visualize linking bias on political websites on Memeorandum.com, an aggregator of political news.

Installation
------------

Memeorandum Colors is a Greasemonkey user-script, which works 
with the Tampermonkey plugin for Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.

When installed, it will color links on Memeorandum based on
each site's historical linking activity.  The brighter the
color, the more they link only to articles in their same
group.



### Installation

2. Click the [memeorandum_colors.user.js](https://github.com/waxpancake/memeorandum-colors/raw/master/memeorandum_colors.user.js) link and click Install in the Tampermonkey window.
4. Visit [Memeorandum](http://memeorandum.com/) and wait a moment for the links to change color.
